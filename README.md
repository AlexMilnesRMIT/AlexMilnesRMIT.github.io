<h2>Interest in IT</h2>

<p>I am very interested in cyber security; in recent times, cyber security has become an essential industry due to the most publicly known cyber-attacks on various federal public and private institutions. I have studied data protection a lot in recent times; I know many people who have fallen victim to identity fraud and have taken action to ensure I will not be attacked. As mentioned earlier, I studied for the diploma in security and risk management; in this course, I took an elective in biometrics. Biometrics only covered the legal aspect of implementation and application; I found it very interesting and was amazed at how regularly it is used in our society; this sparked my interest and realigned my personal goals to change career into the world of technology due to the industry being the fastest growing and most accessible employment wise. (Work anywhere in the world) I currently endeavour to be a cyber security specialist.
  I gained an interest in technology when I was the Security Operations Manager at the ABC headquarters in Sydney; on many occasions, I had to liaison with the technology department to combat and deter cyber security threats, the process behind the responses really interested me, and I have always wanted to learn more.
  I decided to enrol at RMIT because of referrals from alums of the university. They spoke highly of the professionalism and cooperative nature of the faculty. I also decided to enrol at RMIT because I can undertake courses entirely online, which accommodates my current family life.
   I am under the impression that I will be able to comprehend the basic functionalities and roles of the Information Technology industry; as stated before, I wish to enter this world, and this course will give me a good idea and put me on the right track to a profession that suits my abilities and experience in other sectors.
  </p>

<h2>Ideal Job</h2>

<p>A cyber security specialist defends a company's networks, software, and hardware from hackers. The key responsibilities of the analyst are to comprehend the firm's IT infrastructure thoroughly, monitor it continuously, and assess threats that could potentially enter the network. This role is appealing to me because I have worked with this profession in my previous professional life and found it very interesting; it was eye-opening to discover the frequency and the broad range of industries attacked.
  The skills required for such a role would be leadership and decision-making to take charge when cyber-attacks occur and manage a team, strategic planning to proactively implement processes to prevent or minimise the impact of attacks and the ability to work autonomously due to the fast-paced nature of the profession. The bachelor of information security is the standard qualification for various cyber security. Ethical hacking courses are the qualifications required, yet further education is needed, such as a graduate certificate in cyber security and an MBA. Cyber security internships are entry-level positions in the field, yet knowing the essential tasks is required, such as AWS and Azure.
  I have vast knowledge in physical security, staff management and leadership. I have obtained a Diploma of Security and Risk Management, completing this course and my previous professional life rewarded me with vast knowledge in risk assessment of security threat modelling, this was for a physical approach but I am confident I can use these skills in technology.
  First I will finish this degree and aim to start an internship to allow me to learn the skills required in real life workplace situations, a submersion into the industry. Throughout the internship I plan to complete various coding bootcamps and cyber security courses relative to my academic needs. I would like to hold this position with ASIO, this meaning I will have to seek clearance to various security protocols such as the AGSVA security clearance.

<h2>Personal Profile</h2>

<p>The test results opened my eyes to my attributes, and I was unaware of some traits the test claimed I had. I felt very accomplished with the result such as “humanitarian”, “innovator”, and “caretaker”, which I believe are very authentic.
   However, I was also taken aback by such claims of being “judging”; until now, I believed I did not display this trait.
  It would influence my behaviour positively due to claims that I am a “humanitarian” and a “caretaker”. When individuals display such traits, they usually are people and can work efficiently with others. 
  However, on the other hand, innovators can be great people to start ideas and projects. However, from my previous professional experience, they can be stubborn and quarrelsome when requested to do simple tasks. 
  These tests should be taken into account when selecting the hierarchy of a team or organisation. 
  Such traits are not capable in certain positions. For example, people who procrastinate and are weak-willed are not suitable for leadership positions, whereas people who are organised and understanding are good fits.</p>

<h2>Project Idea</h2>

<p>The project is to create a mobile application to be a one-stop guide reference for all aspects of immigration. The app will streamline immigration for users worldwide to have important information at their fingertips. 
  In conjunction with various governments worldwide, it will also serve as a platform for governments to distribute information quickly to their users. 
  The app will be available in over 50 languages and visual and hearing aid for the impaired. It will also work as a communication tool between its users, most of whom would be fellow ex-pats.
 </p>

<p>The motivation to create such an application is because I have first-hand experienced the struggles of immigrating to another country, especially where my mother tongue is not the native language. 
  When I migrated to the country I chose, Brazil, the policies, processes and culture were vastly different to Australia, creating difficult situations for me. 
  These issues could not be resolved quickly or with ease due to not speaking the native language, and I am not the only one; I have heard of similar experiences just here in Brazil; imagine the world.</p>

<p>All features of this project will be available in the user's selected language, with a real-time translation feature similar to Meta products and Uber, allowing users with different languages to communicate efficiently. 
  The product can deliver accurate, detailed information from governments and private bodies to its users in real-time—examples of this being changes to or additional laws being implemented, health orders and emergency alerts. 
  The information can be delivered by push notifications or viewed within a section of the app. This feature will eliminate any missed information and ensure the user (ex-pat/migrate) can process the information without confusion. 
  Formal information about processes and procedures of everyday life within the selected country will also be available, from applying for a local person or business tax registration, opening a business, purchasing property and opening a bank account. 
  All information will be provided via the corresponding agencies via consultation with the developers. Informal information will also be available, from the likes of where to eat, indoor and outdoor activities, going to the supermarket, retail processes, crime/scams, detailed descriptions of local services and the process on how to deal with them, and general knowledge that can be only attained by residing in the selected country. 
  This feature will be mainly user-driven, with a forum feature allowing users to exchange information and advice. Cross-currency payment service will also be a feature of the product, allowing the user to purchase items and services in advance or in real-time; for example, the user can book, give details, negotiate (in selected regions) and pay all on a safe platform. 
  Corresponding rideshare apps can be integrated with the product, such as Uber, Waze, and various selected local apps, and users can order safe travel to and from selected services within the app. 
  Several security validation features will also be present with the project; end-to-end encryption will be programmed into the app, and users will have to valid information entered with a two-step notification and register with local immigration service/law enforcement and native foreign affairs departments ensuring user legitimacy. </p>

  <p>The plan to implement the project will be vast, time-consuming and regional consultation to attain the information required with the app. Representatives of the project will have to reach out to various public and private bodies, such as airlines, travel agencies, and government agencies; 
    the main objective is to seek partnerships and freedom to operate such software within their countries. 
    In countries with open diplomatic relations with Australia, such as the UK, United States and New Zealand the process presumptuously would be more straightforward. In contrast, in countries that do not have diplomatic relations, the process may be more difficult. 
    A team of front-end developers will be required to create the user interface, ensuring it is user-friendly and can be transcribed into the required languages. This project stage will require developers skilled in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. A team of backend developers will also be required to have significant knowledge and skill in the following coding languages: Phyton, Rudy and PHP, to name a few. 
    The primary role of this team is to ensure that the server is always alive and accessible in the required countries.
    Lastly, in the primary stages of the project, a team of translators will be required to ensure that the information attained is translated into the available languages. 
    In the start-up phase, the following languages will be transcribed: English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese, Mandarin and Cantonese; these languages will be selected due to being the most commonly spoken on the planet, and other languages will be added to the following phases. 
    Finding these skills and resources will be a challenging task, but it is feasible. If public or private funding can be issued, the task will require recruiting the right people for the roles and ensuring the project is meeting deadlines.
    </p>

  <p>If the project is successful, it will result in immigration issues that migrants face will be simplified and streamlined. Recent will receive up-to-date information from government and private bodies, safely aiding their transition into their new country. 
    Migrates will not have to navigate through different government websites and apps to do simple tasks for their transition and will not have to wait until they meet others in their new country to seek information on processes, the forum feature of the app will give the user a sense of security and support due to being able to connect with fellow migrates and ex-pats. 
    One of the most significant impacts this project would have is that it will revolutionise international travel and migration. Users will be able to attain information only shared within the local communities, information that mainstream websites do not issue.</p>
